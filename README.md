# Assignment 01 - Portfolio

## Overview
### I created this this project as my 1st portfolio and as an assignment to the BCC-Internship. I created this project using HTML and CSS. Then I pushed it in GitHub using Git commands from my local PC and deployed it in the github pages. Lastly I changed the header style file because I forgot to add a "." infront. Made the form-tab functional. 

## Structure
- HTML
- CSS

## Deadline
- 3 Days

## Note
### Code is good. Keep doing the "good" work.
